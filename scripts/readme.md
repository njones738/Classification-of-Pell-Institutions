Initially, I started with 2,384 variables and 6,806 observations. I filtered out observations that were missing the variable PCTPELL, which will be used to create an indicator variable for either the Majority (greater than 50%) or Minority (50% or less) percentage of the institution's student population receives a Pell grant. I also filtered out observations that were not in one of the 50 states. This process left 5,879 observations.

After finding the number of missing values for each column I dropped columns that was missing all of the values. 
There was 801 variables left over, of which I dropped all debt variables thats name contained "PLUS_DEBT_ALL". These variables include all of the debt the students at that institutions has accumulated over all institutions. Since I am only using one school year, I dropped the variables thats name contained "POOLED" and "SUPP". The other variables I dropped were INSTURL, NPCURL, ALIAS, FEDSCHCD, CIPTITLE1, CIPTITLE2, CIPTITLE3, CIPTITLE4, CIPTITLE5, CIPTITLE6, CIPCODE1, CIPCODE2, CIPCODE3, CIPCODE4, CIPCODE5, and CIPCODE6 since they contain data that is not useful for this project.

Next, I calculated the proportion of missing values and dropped the columns with 42.8% or more missing values. This process left 432 variables, of which 13 variables categorical or ordinal variables and 159 numeric variables needs to be imputed.
